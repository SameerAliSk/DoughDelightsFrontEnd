            <p className="text-center about-us-p">There’s nothing cookie-cutter about Dough Delights. Not our pizzas. Not our people. And definitely not the way we live life. Around here, we don’t settle for anything less than food we’re proud to serve. And we don’t just clock in. Not when we can also become our best, make friends, and have fun while we’re at it. We’re the pizza company that lives life unboxed.</p>

            <h3 className="about-us-h3 text-center">WHERE WE COME FROM</h3>
            <p className="text-center about-us-p">In 1958, two brothers borrowed $600 from their mom to open a pizza place in Wichita, Kansas. They named it Dough Delights, because their sign only had room for eight letters. How profound! Soon, the restaurant grew. Why? The pizza was awesome. The service felt like home. And the customers were treated like family. And we’ve been delivering that same food and service ever since.</p>

            <h3 className="about-us-h3 text-center">FOR THE LOVE OF PIZZA SINCE 1958</h3>
            <p className="text-center about-us-p">From day one, the Carney brothers could look their customers in the eye and promise them the finest pizza in town — because they knew the farmers who grew the ingredients, and they knew those farmers cared about quality. Since then, our farmers have grown right alongside us, and the ingredients we use are still our highest priority. No one loves pizza more than Dough Delights. That’s why pizza is in our name — and always will be.</p>
